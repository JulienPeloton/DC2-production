# SSim_DC2

The repository holds all of the issues, tools and validations used for
the DC2 production. It also holds LaTex files which document the DC2
production strategy and techniques and DESC tech-notes documenting our
findings. There is a GitHub Issues list to track the work necessary to
complete the production. See the Issues and Milestones for more
information.
