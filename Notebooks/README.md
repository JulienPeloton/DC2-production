Notes for Contributors
----------------------

* Before you commit a notebook, please make sure that a) it runs to completion and b) the outputs are cleared (to avoid both repo bloat and conflicts on every run due to semantically equivalent but bitwise-distinct output blobs).

* The "owner" of a notebook (that's you, as its contributor!) is responsible for accepting proposed modifications to it (by collaboration), and making sure that it does not go stale (by fixing issues posted about it).
