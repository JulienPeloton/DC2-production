This directory contains notebooks with demonstration material
convering how to access and use the DC2 datasets. 

Not all of these notebooks should be expected to just work with no
modifications. They are written by various group members and
downloaded from SSim meeting presentations. For this reason, you may
sometimes have to modify the expected input file locations or obtain
the needed input files etc. However, the information in these files
will give you the background you need to write your own analysis and
validation programs.
